# Regulus Waste Management System
Regulus Waste Management System is a software platform designed to revolutionize waste management operations with advanced features and intelligent algorithms. Built to optimize resource utilization, minimize environmental impact, and enhance overall efficiency, Regulus offers a robust platform for existing waste management and processing organizations to streamline their processes and deliver sustainable solutions.

## Features
### Cluster Management
Regulus automatically groups waste payload requests into clusters based on geographical proximity and time constraints. By intelligently organizing payload requests, Regulus ensures efficient allocation of resources and minimizes response times for waste collection operations.

### Dispatch Handling

### Dynamic Routing
Regulus leverages dynamic routing algorithms to calculate optimal routes for collection agents, adapting to real-time traffic conditions and environmental factors. By continuously optimizing routes based on live data, Regulus ensures efficient waste collection operations and reduces carbon emissions associated with transportation.

### Integration with GIS Services
Integration with external geolocation providers allows Regulus to retrieve accurate location information and calculate optimal routes for waste collection operations. By leveraging this geographic APIs, Regulus provides location data and ensures reliable routing for collection agents, even in remote or dynamically changing environments.

### Configurable Wait Time
Regulus offers configurable wait times for waste payload clusters, allowing organizations to define maximum wait durations before dispatching collection agents. By setting wait time thresholds, organizations can ensure timely response to payload requests and prevent unnecessary delays in waste collection operations.
